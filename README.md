# oh-my-posh-themes

This repository contains my personal theme for the [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) tool.

## About

I used examples from the official [oh-my-posh repository](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) to create my personal theme.

## Theme

- **agnoster-by-nab0y4enko.omp.json** - A powerline-style theme based on the agnosterplus theme from the official oh-my-posh themes collection.

## Usage

You can use this theme remotely without downloading it locally. Add the following line to your shell configuration:

### For Zsh (.zshrc)

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh --config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nab0y4enko/oh-my-posh-themes/main/agnoster-by-nab0y4enko.omp.json')"
```

### For other shells

Replace `zsh` with your shell name (bash, fish, pwsh, etc.) in the command above.

For more information on configuration, see the [oh-my-posh documentation](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/general).
