# oh-my-posh-themes

This repository contains my personal theme for the [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) tool.

## About

I used examples from the official [oh-my-posh repository](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) to create my personal theme.

## Theme

- **agnoster-by-nab0y4enko.omp.json** - A powerline-style theme based on the agnosterplus theme from the official oh-my-posh themes collection.
